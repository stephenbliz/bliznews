                I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. 
                That's been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.
                The word "startup" dates from the 1960s, but what happens in 
                one is very similar.

                To be a movie-besotted adolescent in the 70s and early 80s 
                was to experience, in real time and at an impressionable age, 
                performances that would go on to become icons and monuments. 
                This kid doesn't just act — he takes off into the vapors,
                wrote Pauline Kael in her review of Mean Streets. Not that 
                there was anything airy or abstract about what he was doing, 
                which was transforming himself — physically, vocally, 
                psychologically — with each new role. And in the process, 
                before our eyes, reinventing the art of acting.

                To the younger generation, though, he is most recognizably 
                Jack Byrnes, Ben Stiller's impossible father-in-law in the 
                Fockers franchise. And as the reliable heavy in a steady 
                stream of action movies and crime dramas, some but not all 
                of them quite good. It has become fashionable to suggest 
                that De Niro's best work is behind him. But nostalgia is a vice, 
                and a survey of the last four decades of movie history reveals 
                that De Niro has never slackened, diminished or gone away but 
                has rather, year in and year out, amassed a body of work marked
                by a seriousness and attention to detail that was there from the 
                start.
