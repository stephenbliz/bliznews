                I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. 
                That's been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.

                To be a movie-besotted adolescent in the 70s and early 80s 
                was to experience, in real time and at an impressionable age,

                This kid doesnt just act he takes off into the vapors, 
                wrote Pauline Kael in her review of Mean Streets. Not that

                which was transforming himself physically, vocally, 
                psychologically with each new role. And in the process, 
                before our eyes, reinventing the art of acting.
